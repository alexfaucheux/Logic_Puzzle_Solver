LOGIC PUZZLE: Missionaries and Cannibals

GOAL: Move all Missionaries and Cannibals from the left of the river to the right.

RULES: 
1) Number of Cannibals must be <= number of Missionaries on either side of the river.
2) Must use boat to cross river
3) Boat must have someone in it to cross river
4) No more than 2 occupants can be in the boat at a time
5) There are a total of 3 Cannibals and 3 Missionaries
	   
	   
This program solves the classic Missionaries and Cannibals program.
What makes this program unique is that it can solve the puzzle no matter the constraints.

For example: 
1) The classic constraints are (1) 3 total missionaries (2) 3 total cannibals and (3) 2 max inividuals in boat.
2) Custom constraints can be (1) 4 total missionaries (2) 4 total cannibals and (3) 3 max individuals in boat.

			 
Not only does the program finds the solution, it finds the lowest number of moves it takes to be solved
and prints out every solution with that many moves.
